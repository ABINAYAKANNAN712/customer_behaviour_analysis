# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help businesses improve decision-making, customer targeting, and sales strategies. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and common data science libraries.

The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to better understand customer purchasing habits.
